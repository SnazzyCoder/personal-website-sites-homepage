# Mohit Yadav's [Projects Website](https://sites.mohityadav.codes)

This is my showcase website at the `sites` subdomain of `mohityadav.codes`. This is completely personal and self-designed. I generally show my projects, give a description and a sneak peak of each here. If you would like to use as your own website after customizing, refer to [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/SnazzyCoder/sites-homepage/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

## Status

This website is currently under development, and I would be adding more projects and change it later...

## Development

If you would like to help develop this website, consider contacting me at [mohit@mohityadav.codes](mailto://mohit@mohityadav.codes) for the UI designs and references. Thank You...
